## Offline RL
![cart-pole](images/cart_pole.gif)

In this project, we implemented simple imitation learning and fitted Q-learning, and compared their performance against each other on the [cart-pole](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/) game from the Gym environment. We used an online Q-learning agent to obtain our expert data, which we have implemented [previously](https://github.com/Ling01234/SARSA-Function-Approximation).

## Results
We have included the results and their analysis at the end of the [Python notebook](offline_RL.ipynb).

## Extra
